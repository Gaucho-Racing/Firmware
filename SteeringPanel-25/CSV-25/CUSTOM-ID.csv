,,,,0-2,0,Target AC Current,"This command sets the target motor AC current (peak, not
RMS). When the controller receives this message, it
automatically switches to current control mode.
This value must not be above the limits of the inverter and must
be multiplied by 10 before sending. This is a signed parameter,
and the sign represents the direction of the torque which
correlates with the motor AC current. (For the correlation, please
refer to the motor parameters)

function as the “Set AC current” command. Gives you a freedom
to send values between -100,0% and 100,0%. You do not need
to know the motor limit parameters.
This value must be between -100 and 100 and must be
multiplied by 10 before sending. ",,,,,,,,
